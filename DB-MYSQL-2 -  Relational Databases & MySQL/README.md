# DB-MYSQL-2 - Relational Databases & MySQL

 <br/>
 <br/>
 
 
 ## Part 1: Implementing the Generation Students / Courses Database
 
 1. In order to improve the system that you helped to build on the previous Java Module, we need you to create a relational database that allows us to keep track of the courses and students. The system should contain the following tables:
 
 * Students
 * Courses
 * Modules (A set of courses)
 * Countries (To know the nationalities of our students)
 
 2. In order to validate that the system works, and the data is consistent we need you to write *INSERT* queries to add the following data into the database:

| Module                                | Course Code | Course Name                                         |
|---------------------------------------|-------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| Introduction to Computer Science      | INTRO-CS-1  | Introduction to Computer Science                    |
| Introduction to Computer Science      | INTRO-CS-2  | Introduction to Algorithms                          |
| Introduction to Computer Science      | INTRO-CS-3  | Algorithm Design and Problem Solving - Introduction |
| Introduction to Java Programming      | JAVA-1      | Introduction to Java                                |
| Introduction to Java Programming      | JAVA-2      | Java IDE - IntelliJ Idea                            |
| Introduction to Java Programming      | JAVA-3      | Variables, Data Types and Operators                 |
| Introduction to Relational Databasess | DB-MYSQL-1  | Introduction to Relational Databases                |
| Introduction to Relational Databasess | DB-MYSQL-2  | Relational Databases & MySQL                        |
| Introduction to Relational Databasess | DB-MYSQL-3  | Introduction to SQL                                 |

3. Insert 3 students into the students table.

4. Insert the students data into the Foreign table so the students are enrolled in at least one course.

### Challenge Yourself

1. Create an additioanl table to store the student's grades.
