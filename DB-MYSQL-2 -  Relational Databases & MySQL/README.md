# DB-MYSQL-2 - Relational Databases & MySQL

 <br/>
 <br/>
 
 
 ## Part 1: Implementing the Generation Students / Courses Database
 1. In order to improve the system you help build on the previous Java Module we need you to help us create a relational database that allow us to keep record of our courses and students. The system should contain the following tables:
 
 * Students
 * Courses
 * Modules (A set of courses)
 * Schedules
 * Instructors
 * Countries (To know the nationalities of our students)
 
 2. In order to validate that system works and the data is consisten we need you to write queries to insert the following sample data into the database:

| Module                                | Course Code | Course Name                                         |
|---------------------------------------|-------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| Introduction to Computer Science      | INTRO-CS-1  | Introduction to Computer Science                    |
| Introduction to Computer Science      | INTRO-CS-2  | Introduction to Algorithms                          |
| Introduction to Computer Science      | INTRO-CS-3  | Algorithm Design and Problem Solving - Introduction |
| Introduction to Java Programming      | JAVA-1      | Introduction to Java                                |
| Introduction to Java Programming      | JAVA-2      | Java IDE - IntelliJ Idea                            |
| Introduction to Java Programming      | JAVA-3      | Variables, Data Types and Operators                 |
| Introduction to Relational Databasess | DB-MYSQL-1  | Introduction to Relational Databases                |
| Introduction to Relational Databasess | DB-MYSQL-2  | Relational Databases & MySQL                        |
| Introduction to Relational Databasess | DB-MYSQL-3  | Introduction to SQL                                 |

3. Inser 3 students into the students database.

4. Insert the students data into the Foreign table so students are enrolled in at least one course.

### Challenge Yourself

1. Create an additioanl table to store the stuents grades.
